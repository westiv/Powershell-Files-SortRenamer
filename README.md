Hi. This project is called Powershell Files SortRenamer. I am creating this project by ChatGPT guidance on automating renaming multiple files in a folder by using Windows Powershell without needing to put in commands in the Powershell. Although the launcher is in .bat file but it is needed for bypassing execution policy. So I have made it into an app for better use. I have little to no experience in coding and trying to learn more at the moment. This is my first project on GitHub and trying to improve the app by creating more functions, and eventually making GUI for better user interface.
